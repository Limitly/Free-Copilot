According to a [blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/) by Github, 
> Maintainers of popular open source projects / repositories will get 12 month access to Copilot for free.

In order to become eligible you need `write` access to a popular repository which is kind of hard to achieve 🥲 and that's where we come in, [@InimicalPart](https://github.com/inimicalpart) and I ([@1RB](https://github.com/1RB)) have created this repo where **all of you** will get write access 🎉.
<br /> But thats only the first step, the second step is to become a ✨**popular repository**✨ and in order for that to happen we need **your help**!

## What To Do

1. :star: this repo as it is one of the first ways to know how popular a repo is.
2. Open the [`Contributors`](/Contributors/) folder
2. Create a folder with your username inside the folder, this will be your workspace. (`Eg. Contributors/<username>/`)
3. Inside your workspace create a README file. (`Eg. Contributors/<username>/README.md`)
4. Write a little bit about yourself and commit the file to the repository. *You may use [this](/TEMPLATE.md) template*
5. Share this repo around to fellow developers who are looking to get this amazing product for free.

*****⚠️WARNING⚠️**: If you edit any file that is outside of your workspace, you will be removed from your collaborator position and blocked from becoming one in the future.***

> ***Unfortunately as this is a new project it may take a bit to gain traction and for Github to recognise it as an active popular repo.***
