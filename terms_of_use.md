# Terms of Use
By accessing or using the repository, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. These terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the repository. If you do not agree to all of these terms, please do not use the repository.

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, and it is your responsibility to review the terms regularly. If you continue to use the repository after we have modified the terms, you are deemed to have accepted the modified terms.

We reserve the right to deny access to or use of the repository, including denying pull request requests, to anyone for any reason or for no reason, at our sole discretion and without notice or liability. This may include termination of your use or participation in the repository or deletion of any content or information that you have posted.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are not permitted to register for a new account under your own name, a fake name, or the name of any third party, even if you are acting on behalf of the third party. We may also take legal action, including pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive remedies, in response to the termination or suspension of your account.

You understand that we have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the repository and any content or information you post. We may, at our sole discretion and without liability, remove any content or information that we determine to be inappropriate, offensive, or in violation of these terms or any applicable laws or regulations.

You agree to indemnify and hold us and our affiliates, officers, agents, and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the repository, your violation of these terms, or your violation of any rights of another.

You understand that the repository is provided "as is" and "as available," and we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the repository or the information, content, materials, or products included on the repository.

These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the repository and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
